# Media random generator
This is a small JS script that fetches a random image from Imgur (maximum 100) or random Streamable videos (up to 5).\
You can test it here: [https://adamcodd.github.io/media-random-generator](https://adamcodd.github.io/media-random-generator/)
## Imgur generator
Click on the image to view the full size version.\
<b>Warning</b>: Some images might be NSFW. All content displayed here belongs to its respective authors.
## Streamable generator
Once you click on "reload," wait for a moment until you receive a functional URL; it will open a streamable stream in an iframe.
